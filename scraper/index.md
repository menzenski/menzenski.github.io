# Python Scraper

If you've found this page, you've probably seen the user-agent for my
Python scraper.

I'm part of a team of university researchers working on building new
computational resources for [Uyghur][uy], a Turkic language spoken in
northwest China. Many of the resources currently available for Uyghur
are written in Mandarin Chinese.

I have a Uyghur dictionary file in which some words are translated
into English but most words are translated into Mandarin. I've written
this Python scraper to find English translations of those Mandarin
words by looking them up in [Wiktionary][wikt].

I've written this scraper to wait a few seconds between pages, and
take a longer wait after one hundred pages.

If you'd like to drop me a line regarding this scraper, you can reach
me through one of the links on the [Contact Me][contact] page.
