My research interests include verbal aspect in Russian (and in Slavic more generally), verb classification, linguistic typology, North American indigenous languages, digital humanities, literary linguistics, and East European science fiction. These interests are fairly broad, and might seem disconnected from one another, but I like to think that several of them will come together in my dissertation in the next few years. Any that can't be subsumed under my dissertation will hopefully make me a more well-rounded candidate when I go on the job market after defending.

Research and coursework keeps me extremely busy and I don't have any free time, so of course I serve on several committees. I'm currently serving as a graduate student member on both the Open Access Advisory Board as well as the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities Advisory Board here at the University of Kansas.

When I do find that rare free time, I enjoy playing bluegrass and acoustic music (on the guitar, banjo, and mandolin) and riding my bicycle.
