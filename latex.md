# LaTeX Resources

[LaTeX][tex] is a formatting language/document preparation system
popular in mathematics and the hard sciences for its ability to render
equations and diagrams very precisely. LaTeX is not very popular in
the humanities, though, which is a shame: not only does it render
better-looking documents than Microsoft Word (in my opinion, at
least), it handles cross-referencing well and easily produces large
bibliographies (see [this thread][stack] on the TeX StackExchange page
for more reasons why a humanist might be drawn to LaTeX).

I've been using LaTeX since early 2011 and have learned a number of
tricks. In the interests of sharing what I've learned, and also with
the intent to encourage more humanists to look to LaTeX, I'll be
posting some LaTeX resources on this page.

### University of Kansas Dissertation Class in XeLaTeX

This code is available in a [GitHub repository][xelatexclass]. You can
see a sample document generated with this code [here][demopdf].

A KU LaTeX dissertation class had already put together several years ago by
KU professor [Paul E. Johnson][PaulJohnson]. It's great, but it didn't meet my
needs as a Slavistâ€”I need support for Cyrillic text (including some
medieval characters) as well as phonetic symbols.
