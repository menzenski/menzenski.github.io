# Python and NLTK Materials

This page contains links to the materials used in the
[2015 Digital Jumpstart Workshop][idrh] "Introduction to Text Analysis with
Python and the Natural Language Toolkit".

* All the Python code is available [here][pyth], on my GitHub page.

* The text of *Fathers and Sons*, the novel by Ivan Turgenev we're using as a
  source text in the workshop, is available on
  [Project Gutenberg][gutenberg] (you'll want the "Plain Text UTF-8"
  format). If you're using a free account on [Python Anywhere][pa],
  you'll need to use [the version I've rehosted there][patext] (free
  accounts are restricted to the `pythonanywhere.com` domain).

* The 'dummy' website we're using to scrape text from HTML is [here][dummy].

* The slides for the workshop presentation are available [on figshare][figshare].

* If you're interested in the LaTeX code of the presentation itself,
  I wrote it on [Overleaf][ol]. You can see the code [here][latexcode]
  (read-only), or `git clone` the project through
  [this link][gitlink]. This presentation uses the `mtheme` Beamer
  theme, available [here][mtheme].

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
