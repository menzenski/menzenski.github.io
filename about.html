    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a second-year MA student in the Department of Slavic
    Languages and Literatures at the University of Kansas. I'm
    planning to join the PhD program in Slavic Linguistics in the same
    department next year.</p>
    <p>My research interests include Russian verbal aspect, verb
    classification, linguistic typology, North American indigenous
    languages, digital humanities, literary linguistics, and East European
    science fiction. These interests are fairly broad, and might seem
    disconnected from one another, but I like to think that many of
    them will come together in my dissertation in the next few years.</p>
