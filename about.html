    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a second-year MA student in the Department of Slavic
    Languages and Literatures at the University of Kansas. I'm
    planning to join the PhD program in Slavic Linguistics in the same
    department next year.</p>
    <p>My research interests include Russian verbal aspect, verb
    classification, linguistic typology, North American indigenous
    languages, digital humanities, literary linguistics, and East European
    science fiction. These interests are fairly broad, and might seem
    disconnected from one another, but I like to think that many of
    them will come together in my dissertation in the next few
    years. Any that can't be subsumed under my dissertation will
    hopefully help me be a more well-rounded candidate when I go on
    the job market after defending.</p>
    <p>Research and coursework keeps me extremely busy and I don't
    have any free time, so of course I serve on several
    committees. I'm currently serving as a graduate student member on
    both the Open Access Advisory Board as well as the Institute for
    Digital Research in the Humanities Advisory Board here at the
    University of Kansas.</p>
    <p>When I do find that rare free time, I enjoy playing bluegrass
    and acoustic music (on the guitar, banjo, and mandolin) and riding
    my bike.</p>
