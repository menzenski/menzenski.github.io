There's an [article on Ars Technica][AT] today describing the emerging
"WikiGate" storyâ€”Elsevier, the scholarly publishing juggernaut, has donated 45
ScienceDirect accounts to [The Wikipedia Library][WL], which "top
Wikipedia Editors" may use in their efforts to add content to Wikipedia.
(Elsevier's own press release on the matter is [here][Elsevier]).

Elsevier's action has generated a polarizing response in the Open Access
community, with Michael Eisen, a co-founder of the Open Access megajournal
[*Public Library of Science*][PLOS], [tweeting][EisenTweet] that he's "shocked
to see @wikipedia working hand-in-hand with Elsevier to populate encylopedia
w/links people cannot access". Peter Murray-Rust, Reader Emeritus in Molecular
Informatics at the University Of Cambridge and founder of [ContentMine][CM],
likewise described in a [blog post][PMRblog] how Wikipedia is essentially just
providing free advertising for Elsevier and getting nothing in return.

The responses I've seen which are in favor of Wikipedia's acceptance of
Elsevier's donation tend to take the view that (and I am paraphrasing here)
"Sure, Open-Access-only would be nice, but Wikipedia has to operate in the real
world, not an ideal world". The follow-up question we should be asking is
**how do we move from the current scholarly publishing climate towards a more
open one?**

Eisen has [proposed][EisenTweet2] that Wikipedia provide citations, but not
links, to paywalled Elsevier articles. I disagree. I think a better strategy
would be to link to those paywalled articles through the
[Open Access Button][OAB], a great tool for measuring the extent to which
readers don't have access to the research they need. (I cannot claim to be the
first to have thought of this: Andrea Zanni also [suggests][AZ] this, and
others likely do as well).

Imagine a URL (say, `http://www.openaccessbutton.org/?linkthrough=` or
something similar) which could be prepended to any link to a paywalled journal
article. That paywall page would be displayed in a window of the resulting
page, with the area outside that window providing a link to the Open Access
Button and the message "Can't access this research? Click here to register to
help us measure the accessibility of research like this".

There could even be an option to send a message to the corresponding author (this functionality now exists in the relaunched Open Access Button),
prepopulated with a paragraph letting the author know that her paper is linked
to on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia and one of the most-visited websites in
the world, but that it's hidden behind a paywall and inaccessible to much of
Wikipedia's readership.

I love the Open Access Button, and I think it's underutilized. Its use in links
from Wikipedia to paywalled articles would be a great way to (1) make more
people outside of the Open Access community aware of the Button, and (2) allow
the Open movement to gain a real return from Elsevier's donation of
ScienceDirect accounts, by providing real data on how many people need access
to scholarly research and can't get it. (It would also help push back against
the elitist notion that members of the public aren't interested in scholarly
research output and thus don't need Open Access).
