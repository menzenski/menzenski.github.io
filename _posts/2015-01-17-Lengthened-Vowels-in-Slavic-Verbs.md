The particular semantics of the aspects vary from language to language, but generally, use of the perfective (pf) is associated with completed actions, actions viewed in their totality, and actions occurring at a definite point in time, while use of the imperfective (ipf) is associated with actions in process, actions considered with reference to their internal temporal makeup, and repeated actions.

### Types of Perfective Verbs in Russian

In Russian, verbs are frequently grouped into *aspectual pairs* containing an imperfective and its corresponding perfective, e.g., <span class="russ">читать/прочитать</span> (<span class="trans">čitat'/pročitat'</span> in transliteration) 'read (ipf and pf respectively)'. There are several strategies for forming the members of an aspectual pair. There are some eighteen verbal prefixes in Russian, each of which results in a perfective verb. 

Prefixation leads to multiple sorts of perfective verbs in Russian: some prefixed perfectives (typically just one for a given simplex imperfective) are considered *natural perfectives*&mdash;in these perfectives, like the <span class="trans">pro-</span> in <span class="trans">čitat'/pročitat'</span> above, the prefix is considered to be 'semantically empty' aside from the perfective meaning. Others are *procedural perfectives* (also called Complex Act Perfectives), e.g., <span class="russ">почитать</span> (<span class="trans">počitat'</span>) 'to read for a while (pf)'&mdash;these prefixes set some sort of boundary on an action, and frequently have connotations like 'to do something for a while', 'to start to do something', 'to stop doing something', or 'to do something for a certain period of time'.

A third group of prefixed perfective verbs are *lexical perfectives* (also called Specialized Perfectives). While in procedural perfectives the prefix might be said to add a small amount of new semantic content aside from perfective meaning, in lexical perfectives the prefix adds enough additional semantic content that the resulting perfective verb is considered lexically distinct from the simplex (i.e., not prefixed and not suffixed) imperfective. As a result, in an aspectual pair the imperfective partner of a lexical perfective is not the simplex imperfective, but a new, *derived imperfective* formed from the prefixed verb by the addition of an imperfectivizing suffix. The verb <span class="russ">перечитать</span> (<span class="trans">perečitat'</span>) 're-read (pf)' is a lexical perfective formed from <span class="russ">читать</span> (<span class="trans">čitat'</span>) 'read', but its imperfective partner is  <span class="russ">перечитывать</span> (<span class="trans">perečityvat'</span>) 're-read (ipf)', formed with the imperfectivizing suffix <span class="russ">-ыва-</span> (<span class="trans">-yva-</span>).

### Imperfectivizing Morphology and Vowel Alternation

The suffix <span class="russ">-ыва-</span> (<span class="trans">-yva-</span>) is the most common imperfectivizing suffix in modern Russian, and the only one which is productive. A look at Russian aspectual morphology, though, reveals that there are a number of imperfectivizing strategies which are fossilized in the modern language&mdash;that is, they're used on some verbs which have retained those markers, but they aren't being applied to any newly introduced verbs. One of these imperfectivizing strategies is the focus of this project (and will be one of the main topics for this blog): the <span class="russ">-бирать</span> (<span class="trans">-birat'</span>) type.

There is a group of verbs in Russian (and in the other Slavic languages; they'll be compared in a later post) characterized by a *root vowel alternation* between the infinitive and the nonpast forms. In modern Russian, this alternation comes in three basic flavors:

* A vowel in the nonpast stem alternates with the lack of a vowel in the infinitive, e.g., the <span class="trans">-ber-</span> of <span class="russ">беру</span> (<span class="trans">beru</span>) 'I take' (nonpast) vs. the <span class="trans">-br-</span> in <span class="russ">брать</span> (<span class="trans">brat'</span>) 'to take' (infinitive). This nonpast stem vowel is always <span class="trans">-e-</span> with one exception, the <span class="trans">-o-</span> of <span class="russ">зову</span> (<span class="trans">zovu</span>) 'I call' (but there's good reason to believe that that <span class="trans">-o-</span> actually derives from a historical <span class="trans">\*-e-</span>).

* There is no vowel in the nonpast stem, while the infinitive contains either a vowel, or two identical vowels separated by a consonant, e.g., the zero vowel of nonpast <span class="russ">мру</span> (<span class="trans">mru</span>) 'I die' vs. the <span class="trans">-ere-</span> of <span class="russ">мереть</span> (<span class="trans">meret'</span>) 'to die', or the zero vowel of nonpast <span class="russ">жгу</span> (<span class="trans">žgu</span>) 'I burn' vs. the <span class="trans">-e-</span> of the infinitive <span class="russ">жечь</span> (<span class="trans">žeč'</span>) 'to burn' (here the <span class="russ">-чь</span> [<span class="trans">-č'</span>] represents underlying <span class="russ">\*-г-ть</span> [<span class="trans">\*-g-t'</span>]).

* There is no vowel in the nonpast stem, and there is likewise no vowel in the infinitive, e.g., nonpast <span class="russ">жду</span> (<span class="trans">ždu</span>) 'I wait' vs. infinitive <span class="russ">ждать</span> (<span class="trans">ždat'</span>).

What do these three groups of verbs have in common? And why is that third group included with the first two, if there's no vowel alternation taking place? The next post in this blog will touch upon the reasons for treating them together.
