Welcome to my blog! I've decided that I need to be writing a lot more,
and blogging seems like a great way to do that. One of my main goals
in writing this blog is to be more open about my research. There are
two projects I'm working at the moment which are independent of my
present coursework (although each began as a term paper), and each is
large enough in scope that the endpoint isn't anywhere in sight yet. I
hope that blogging will both allow me to create a meaningful record of the
research *process* as well as disseminate my research to a broader
audience than I might otherwise be able to reach.
