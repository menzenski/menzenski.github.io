I haven't posted anything to this blog in three months, and in large
part that was because I was studying for my MA/PhD qualifying
exams. I'm happy to report that I've now made it through those exams.

Last week I passed the oral exam (the third and final portion), which
means that I'll be staying in Lawrence for a while longer (a *long*
while longer). I'm super excited to be starting the PhD in Slavic
Linguistics at KU. This department is the right place for me and I'm
glad to be able to remain here in Lawrence.

This has been a good week all around, actually. Last Wednesday I signed
the contract for my summer employment. I'll be working at KU as a
computational linguistics consultant for a nonprofit organization,
working to create digital and computational resources for an
endangered language of Central Asia.

Have a good end of the semester, everyone!
