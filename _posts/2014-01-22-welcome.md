#### Welcome to my blog!

If you've found this page, you likely already know who I am, but on
the chance that you don't, I'm a graduate student in Slavic
Linguistics, with a strong interest in Digital Humanities.

With this blog, I hope to:

* *Hold myself accountable:* I'm entirely self-taught when it comes
  to programming, and find that putting my code on a public site like
  this one forces me to adhere more closely to coding's best
  practices.
* *Record the development of scripts and ideas:* As my coding skills
  improve, the scripts I write are getting more and more complex, and
  they require more careful planning ahead of the actual coding
  process. I hope that this blog will serve as a 'white paper' of
  sorts, laying out my reasoning and helping others (and me!) to
  understand just what this code is doing.
* *Participate more in the open-source community:* I've been
  interested in open-source software for several years now, but I've
  always been a consumer of open-source software rather than a
  producer. It's my intent to make available small pieces of software
  through this site and in doing so take a more proactive role in the
  open-source community.


Here's a test code snippet:  
{% highlight python linenos %}
def code_goes_here():
    pass
{% endhighlight %}
