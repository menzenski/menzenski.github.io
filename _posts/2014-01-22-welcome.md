### Welcome to my blog!

If you've found this page, you likely already know who I am, but on the chance that you don't, I'm a first-year graduate student in Slavic Linguistics, with a strong interest in Digital Humanities. 

With this blog, I hope to:

* *Hold myself accountable:* I'm entirely self-taught when it comes
  to programming, and find that putting my code on a public site like
  this one forces me to adhere more closely to coding's best
  practices.
* *Record the development of scripts and ideas:*
* *Participate more in the open-source community*


Here's a test code snippet:  
{% highlight python linenos %}
def code_goes_here():
    pass
{% endhighlight %}
