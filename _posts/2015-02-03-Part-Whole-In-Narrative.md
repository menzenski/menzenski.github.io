title: Metonymy and Narrative Structure
description: "William Croft's Radical Construction Grammar requires
only one syntactic structure to account for the complexity of the
world's languages: the part-whole relationship of grammatical
constructions. That's a bold claim, but the relationship between a
whole and its parts is even more powerful an explanatory force than
Croft makes it out to be."

Jerome Bruner's article "The Narrative Construction of Reality" is a
heady one. While it's likely true that any article purporting to
discuss the underpinnings of reality and the basic elements of human
existence is bound to be complicated, it should tell you something
about Bruner's that I made sense of it by explaining it to myself in
terms of computer programming languages.

Anyone who's studied literature a little has an understanding of some
of the basic building blocks of narrative: a story is a self-contained
narrative, a character is someone in a story, a plot is the series of
events that take place in a story, and so on. Understanding narratives
to this degree is like programming in Python.

Python is a high-level programming language, which makes it broadly
applicable. You can run Python on just about any computer without too
much difficulty, because in Python you don't have to worry about all the
particular ways a programming language interfaces with the computer
hardware it's installed on.
