It's too soon to know for sure, of course, but I feel strongly that
this past weekend will shape my academic future in a big way. I spent
a few days in Washington, D.C. for OpenCon 2014, a conference for
students and early-career researchers on Open Access, Open Educational
Resources, and Open Data. I'm still processing all the things that
happened at OpenCon (and likely will be for some time), but I wanted
to try and summarize some of the thoughts and questions I'm taking
away from this conference.

One of my big takeaways was that I actually have something to offer to
the Open movement. Or rather, that I have something specific to
offer. It's not that I didn't know my own interests and strengths. I
am many things: a linguistics student with some text mining skills,
a literature student interested in digital humanities, a Russian
speaker, a member of two university advisory boards (for Open Access
and our Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities). But before
this weekend, I did not know that I was an advocate too.

Don't get me wrong, I knew that I cared about Open, and I knew that I
wanted to contribute to the wonderful work that's being done by my
OpenCon peers and others around the world. 

This post will be changing often, as I add things. Sorry.
