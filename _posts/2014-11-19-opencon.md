It's too soon to know for sure, of course, but I feel strongly that
this past weekend will shape my academic future in a big way. I spent
a few days in Washington, D.C. for OpenCon 2014, a conference for
students and early-career researchers on Open Access, Open Educational
Resources, and Open Data. I'm still processing all the things that
happened at OpenCon (and likely will be for some time), but I wanted
to try and summarize some of the thoughts and questions I'm taking
away from this conference.

One of my big takeaways was that I actually have something to offer to
the Open movement. Or rather, that I have something specific to
offer. It's not that I didn't know my own interests and strengths. I
am many things: a linguistics student with some text mining skills,
a literature student interested in digital humanities, a Russian
speaker, a member of two university advisory boards (for Open Access
and our Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities). But before
this weekend, I did not know that I was an *advocate* too.

Don't get me wrong, I knew that I cared about Open, and I knew that I
wanted to contribute to the wonderful work that's being done by my
OpenCon peers and others around the world. I knew that I had skills
that could be valuable. But I thought that the way to get involved was
through someone else's project. There are some really wonderful and
impressive projects being built and developed by other OpenCon
attendees, from Mitar Milutinovic's
[PeerLibrary](https://peerlibrary.org/) to Marcin Wojnarski's
[Paperity](http://paperity.org) to David Carroll and Joe McArthur *et
al.*'s [Open Access Button](https://www.openaccessbutton.org) to
Martin Paul Eve and Caroline Edward's
[Open Library of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org)---the list
goes on. Literally every attendee, it seemed, was working on something
great. Except me.

I tweeted a lot at OpenCon. **A lot**. Like
[more-than-anyone-else a lot](https://twitter.com/sibelefausto/status/535541680234311680)
(at least with the
[#opencon2014](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23opencon2014&src=typd)
hashtag). And you know, a lot of interesting things happened on
Twitter. Most of the presentations this weekend seemed to concern
fields like the hard sciences, or medicine, or education. Except for
Martin Paul Eve, who gave a fascinating talk on the Open Library of
Humanities, there wasn't much direct mention of the social sciences or
the humanities among the conference presentations. But there was on
Twitter. 

This post will be changing often, as I add things. Sorry.
