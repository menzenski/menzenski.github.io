It's too soon to know for sure, of course, but I feel strongly that
this past weekend will shape my academic future in a big way. I spent
a few days in Washington, D.C. for OpenCon 2014, a conference for
students and early-career researchers on Open Access, Open Educational
Resources, and Open Data. I'm still processing all the things that
happened at OpenCon (and likely will be for some time), but I wanted
to try and summarize some of the thoughts and questions I'm taking
away from this conference.

One of my big takeaways was that I actually have something to offer to
the Open movement. Or rather, that I have something specific to
offer. 

This post will be changing often, as I add things. Sorry.
