  abstract: "Janda et al. (2013) propose an analysis of Russian aspectual prefixes as verb classifiers, arguing that the prefix which forms the 'natural perfective' from a given verb serves to classify that verb according to its semantic characteristics. This analysis contrasts with the traditional analysis of Russian aspect, described by Tixonov (1998) and others, in which natural perfectives are formed via the addition of 'empty' prefixes which contribute no semantic content of their own. In Tohono O’odham (formerly known as Papago, an Uto-Aztecan language spoken in present-day Arizona and Mexico), as in Russian, there is a broad two-way distinction between two aspects, perfective and imperfective (Saxton 1982:232). In a fashion similar to the traditional aspectological assumption that there are lexically empty perfectivizing prefixes in Russian, traditional analyses of O’odham aspect posit a process of lexically empty perfectivization. In O’odham, the perfective is usually considered to be formed from the imperfective by truncation of the final consonant, in large part due to a lack of clear and separable semantic content in that segment (Mason 1950; Hale 1965; Saxton 1982; Zepeda 1983; Hill & Zepeda 1992; Kosa 2008). In this paper, I argue instead that O’odham imperfective verbs are formed from perfective verbs by suffixation, and that the suffixes involved are not ‘empty’, but serve a verb-classifying function similar to that of aspectual prefixes in Russian. Imperfectivizing suffixes have been proposed in the literature, by Dolores (1913) and Stonham (1994), but this hypothesis has not yet been systematically investigated. This paper represents a first attempt to do so. Data for this study are drawn from a nearly 5,000-verb database created from a two-volume dictionary of Tohono O’odham usage (Mathiot 1973a; 1973b). A preliminary analysis of these verbs supports a correlation between the final consonant of the imperfective and the verb’s lexical semantics, demonstrating that like those of Russian, O’odham aspectual morphemes fulfill the criteria for a verb classifier system as described by McGregor (2002), and providing further evidence that research on Slavic aspect can inform typological studies of verbal aspect cross-linguistically."

  abstract: "The Baltic and Slavic reflexes of the Indo-European syllabic resonants *m̥, *n̥, *r̥, *l̥ are a combination of short vowel plus resonant (ĭm, ĭn, ĭr, ĭl with variants ŭm, ŭn, ŭr, ŭl possible); this is assumed to represent a common Balto-Slavic development (Shevelov 1965: 82). The subsequent lengthening of -ĭ- and —ŭ- to -i- and -y-, respectively, in verbs derived with the suffix *-ā- (often termed an iterative suffix, but in truth expressing a range of durative meanings, including states and cyclic activities), e.g., OCS -birati ‘gather’ (cf. non-lengthened -bĭrati) and Lithuanian klūpoti ‘be kneeling’ (cf. klupti ‘kneel down’), is also often claimed to be a common Balto-Slavic innovation (Schmalstieg: 2000; Villanueva Svensson 2011; Pronk 2012), formed through analogy with lengthened derivatives of e-grade verbs, e.g., Slavic -mětati ~ Latvian mę̃tãt ‘to throw repeatedly’ and Slavic -těkati ~ Latvian tę̃kãt ‘to be running’ (Endzelīns 1971: 227). Mathiassen (1974: 137–138) rejects this line of reasoning, arguing that the Slavic iterative derivation -mětati only came about after the rise of the perfective/imperfective distinction in Slavic. Schuyt (1990: 381) likewise proposes a separate origin for zero-grade lengthening in Slavic and Baltic, citing accentological evidence. In this paper, I build upon Mathiassen’s initial criticism and argue that the current state of affairs in Baltic and Slavic could only have resulted from separate processes of zero-grade lengthening in the two language families, with apparent parallel forms such as (prefixed) Russian za-minaju ‘I crush’ (cf. non-lengthened za-mnu) and (simplex) Lithuanian mynioju ‘I trample’ (cf. non-lengthened minu) resulting not from shared innovation, but rather from formally similar yet functionally distinct processes. Specifically, I take a Construction Grammar approach and argue that the lengthened zero-grade in Slavic necessarily arose after the rise of the perfective/imperfective distinction. Prior to the grammaticalization of aspect, prefixes contributed spatial and directional meaning. Once prefix + verb combinations had become constructionalized (i.e., obligatorily expressing perfective meaning), a functional need arose for imperfective verbs with those same spatial/directional prefixes, and it was this need that drove the analogical extension of the lengthened grade from existing verb pairs, e.g., lětati ‘to be flying’ (cf. non-lengthened letěti) to zero-grade verbs. This paper thus contributes to a more detailed understanding of the grammaticalization of aspect in Slavic, and in particular, of the development of a major method of imperfective derivation. The relation of this zero-grade lengthening to the development of the Slavic imperfect tense is also considered, especially in light of Kamphuis’ (2014) view of the imperfect as the first derived form in the imperfective paradigm."
