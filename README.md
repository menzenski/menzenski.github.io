# Matt Menzenski's Site

This repository hosts my personal GitHub Pages site.

On this page I'm using the [Balzac][Balzac] theme by
[Cole Townsend][Townsend] ([@twnsndco][TownsendTwitter]), who has shared it under the
[MIT License][MIT]. I've only modified the theme a little bit, by
adding CSS and font support for displaying Russian and Old Church
Slavic scripts.

Unless otherwise stated, all the content on this site is
free to use and re-use under a [Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 License][cc].
